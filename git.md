## Distributed version control system 

It is a tool or process where multiple teams or developers can work together in the repository called collaboration. Multiple developers can access or update the file at the same time and it will be shown in a git repository. everything will be track who has made the changes. Here millions of developers can work on the same git repository and it is the main advantage of using a distributed version control system. In centralize version control systems only one developer can work at a time .while he working on that no other developers can work on that. In the Distributed system it has local and remote. Git maintains own local repository by remote all repository are sink.
