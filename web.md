# Basic building block of web application development.

## IP Address 

IP address stands for internet protocol address. Internet Assigned Number Authority(IANA) started to assign Ip address. An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. In networking, no application can work without an IP address which acts as an identifier for a specific machine on a particular network. By using the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) an IP address is converted to a physical address. If an IP address is your location, then your MAC address is your name. You may change your location, but your name remains the same.


#### Types of IP address
#### 1. Public IP address
a Public IP address is the IP address assigned to the network by the ISP.
A public IP address is used to connect outside from organization. it is also locally visible by logging into the router configuration. A public IP address is assigned to every device that connects to the Internet and each IP address is unique.

#### 2. Private IP address
Private IP address is used within the organization This is also called Loopback IP address
If you have a router, you have a private IP address. The private address ranges in a network don’t have to be synchronized with the rest of the world and the Internet.

#### 3. Dynamic IP addresses
Dynamic IP addresses change automatically and regularly. There are security advantages of Dynamic IP address because a changing IP address makes it harder for criminals to hack into your network interface.

#### 4. Static IP addresses
 static Ip addresses remain constant. Once the network assigns an IP address, it remains the same. 

--------------
 #### Versions of IP address
* IPv4

IPv4 was the first version of IP. Today it is the most widely used IP version. IPv4 defines an IP address as a 32-bit number. It is used to identify devices on a network using an addressing system. In IPv4 binary bits are separated by a dot(.)

* IPv6

It is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol. In IPv6 binary bits are separated by a colon (:). It has Hierarchical addressing and routing infrastructure. IPv6 is a 128-Bit IP address. 

------------------
#### Classification of IP address
 * `Class A `

Class A  is used for large number of total hosts.
The range of Class A is 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0 and 
Octal value of class A is 1-127

* `Class B` 

Class B is used for medium size network.
The range of Class B 128.0.0.0 to 191.0.0.0 and 
Octal value of class B is 128-191


* `Class` C  

Class C is used for local area network.
The range of Class  C 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0 and 
Octal value of class C is 192-223


* `Class D`  

Class D is Reserve for multi-tasking.
The range of Class D 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 and
Octal value of class D is 224-239


* `Class E`  

The range of Class E 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255 .
Class E is reserved for research and Development Purposes and 
Octal value of class E is 240-255

---------------------

## Port 

A port is an entry point to any application. a port number is ranging from 0 to 65535.  An IP address and port are used to powered web applications. It is like an address if I want to go in Abha apartment room number 602. The 602 is similar to a port number, indicating that we must proceed to the 6th floor, the second room. That’s why without a port, the web application can't be run.

---------------

## Web Port (HTTP and HTTPS)

Web port gathers data and manages communications for multiple control system devices. It is designed by numbers. HTTP uses port 80 and HTTPS uses port 443 by default. all production applications run in 443.  

-------------------

## Domain

It is like a name that is created by IANA authority and currently controlled by ICNN. A domain name is given to a company, by domain name system (DNS) those domain name is pointing to an IP address .for example google.com, PayTm. 

----------------

## Browser
A web browser is application software for accessing web applications. Without a browser, we can’t build a web application. Browserstack will test your application on all the  browsers which are available in the market
#### List of web browsers

* Google chrome
* Firefox
* Opera
* Internet Explorer
* Brave
* Safari
* UC Browser

-----------------------------


## Web Server 

Your web applications are hosted on a web server. on a web server, the HTTP server is responsible for processing and answering incoming requests. It received a request and send reposed. A web server’s job is to provide web pages to the user.

 #### List of web servers

* Nginx
* Apache 2.0
* Light HTTP
----------------------------


## HTTP verbs
#### These are mainly used HTTP verbs
* GET : It is used to fetch data

* POST : It is mainly used to create new resources

* PUT : It is mainly used to update data

* DELETE : It is used to delete data 

* OPTION : It is used to retrieve the available HTTP verbs for a given resource

* HEAD : It same as GET. It is used for testing hypertext links for validity, accessibility, and recent modification

-----------------
## HTTP Headers

 The header is like a definition of which browser is sending or any application sending to the server and based on that server decide to do something. A browser sends request Headers to the server. server and browser communicate using Headers. It is like an envelope. we exchange the envelope but nobody knows what is been exchanged.

---------------------

## HTTP status codes

HTTP status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been completed.

 Following are HTTP status codes.

* 1xx :  informational response. 
* 2xx : It indicates a successful request.
* 3xx : request migration or redirection.
* 4xx : It indicates client error such as page not found, bad syntax, authentication)
* 5xx: It indicates an application-specific error.

---------------------------

## Software Licence

Any software development can not happen without a software license. It provides legal protection and security to a company or user.

#### List of Software license
* Apache 2.0
* MIT
* BSD
* GPL
* Mozilla

-------------------------

## Database 

A database is a collection of information that is organized so that it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS).  

#### Two types of database

#### 1.Relational Database 

relational databases store data in rows and columns like a spreadsheet.

List of relational databases.
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* MariaDB


#### 2. Non-Relational Database

A non-relational database is any database that does not use the tabular schema of rows and columns like in relational databases.

List of Non relational databases.

* MongoDB
* Redis
* NeoJs
* Cassandra

-------------------------

## Cloud Providers 

#### list of cloud service providers:
* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Azure.
* Google Cloud.
* Alibaba Cloud.
* IBM Cloud.
* BlueMix.
* Digital Ocean.
* Vultr.
* Salesforce.
* SAP.
* Netify
* Heruko

------------------------
## Code Repository

A code repository is a data structure for storing metadata about a collection of files or directory structure.

-----------------------------
#### list of Cloud Repository

* Github
* Gitlab
* BitBucket
